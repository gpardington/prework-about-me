      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Not exactly sure, but I would love to work in the ski industry or maybe even the music industry. Building websites or apps for some of my favorite ski comapnies or resorts would be pretty cool!</p>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>After over 5 years of working in the hospitality industry I really want to learn how to make websites and apps as intuitive as possible. I believe that learning web development will help me shift my career while still utilizing my experience in hospitality.</p>
